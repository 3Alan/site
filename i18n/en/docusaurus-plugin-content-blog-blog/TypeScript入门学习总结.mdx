  This TypeScript tutorial is all you need to get started with TypeScript. It
  covers the basics of TypeScript.

summary: >-
  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and
  class-based object-oriented programming to JavaScript. TypeScript can be
  compiled to plain JavaScript, and uncompiled ts code cannot be executed in the
  browser. We can understand its relationship with JavaScript as the
  relationship between css and less, sass.


  TypeScript has the following advantages:


  - It can perform dynamic type checking, which can detect some potential bugs
    (such as spelling errors, missing parameters, undefined, etc.),
    improving the robustness of the code.

  - Using vscode for development can provide good code prompts, improving
    development efficiency.

  - Good code readability.


  The basic types in TypeScript include: boolean, number, string, array, tuple,
  enum, any, void, null, and undefined.


  Classes in TypeScript are very similar to classes in ES6, except that classes
  in TypeScript can have access modifiers (public, private, protected), static
  properties, and abstract methods.


  Generics in TypeScript refer to a feature where specific types are not
  pre-specified when defining functions, interfaces, or classes, but are
  specified when used. Generics can improve code reusability.


  React-related knowledge in TypeScript includes:


  - Class component dynamically sets state: You can use `this.setState({ [name]:
    value } as Pick<CompontentState, keyof CompontentState>)` to dynamically
    set state.

## What is TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which adds optional **static types** and class-based object-oriented programming to JavaScript. It can be compiled into pure JavaScript, and uncompiled ts code cannot be executed in the browser. We can understand its relationship with JavaScript as the relationship between css and less, sass.

## What are the advantages of TypeScript

- TS can perform dynamic type checking, which can detect some potential bugs (such as spelling errors, missing parameters, undefined, etc.), improving the robustness of the code.
- Using vscode for development can provide good code prompts, improving development efficiency.
- Good code readability.

## Create the first TypeScript file

First install TypeScript

```
npm install -g typescript
```

Check if it is successful after installation

```
tsc --version
```

I encountered the following problems after installation:

![image-20200614175730166](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200614175730166.png)

In this case, you only need to open the command line as an administrator and run the following command:

```
set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Create the first ts file `Hello.ts`

```tsx
function sayHello(name: String) {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
}
let person = 'Alan';
sayHello(person);
```

We found that the ts code is slightly different from the ordinary js code in the parameter of the `sayHello` function.
`sayHello(name: String)`
It roughly means that `sayHello` passes in a parameter named name, and the type of the parameter must be `String`, otherwise it cannot pass the compilation of ts.
After writing the code, use tsc to compile the above `Hello.ts` file

```
tsc Hello.ts
```

After successful compilation, a `Hello.js` file is generated in the same level directory. It can be seen that the generated js file only converts the es6 syntax to es5 syntax, and does not change other codes.

```js
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log('Hello ' + name);
}
var person = 'Alan';
sayHello(person);
```

If you rewrite the `Hello.ts` file

```tsx
function sayHello(name: String) {
  const text = 3 + name;
  console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
}
let person = 123;
sayHello(person);
```

Compile again and find that an error will be reported, but the js file can still be generated:
![image-20200614180440953](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200614180440953.png)

The specific meaning of the above error is

- Since the function parameter `name` is declared as a static type `string`, when calling, the value passed in is `number` type `123`, which does not match the previous `string`.
- In the `sayHello` function, two values of different types, `name(string)` and `3(number)`, are added.

We found that every time we have to compile the ts file through tsc to get the js file and then run the js file, it is too troublesome. You can use the plugin `ts-node` to directly run the ts file.

```
npm i ts-node -g
```

```
ts-node Hello.ts
```

:::info

ts can try to analyze variable types (type inference), and ts cannot analyze variables. It is best to explicitly declare variable types (type annotations)

:::

## Basic types

Variable declaration: `let [variable name]: [type] = value`

For example: `let age: number = 21`

TypeScript supports almost the same data types as JavaScript

- boolean (Boolean value)
- number (numerical)
- string (string)
- `[]/Array<element type> (array)`
- Tuple
- enum (enumeration)
- any (any value)
- void (empty value)
- null
- undefined
- never

## Array

There are 2 ways to define an array

```tsx
let arr: number[] = [1, 2, 3]; // Element type followed by `[]`
let arr: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3]; // Array generics
let arr: (number | string)[] = [1, '2', '4']; // Element type can be number or string (similar to tuple)
```

## Tuple tuple

Represents an array (the types of each element do not have to be the same)

```tsx
let list: [string, number]; // The first element is of type string, and the second is of type number
a = ['abc', 123]; // qualified
b = [123, 'abc']; // unqualified
```

## Enumeration

It's actually a bit like an object
Look at the example

```tsx
enum lan {js, ts, css};
console.log(lan.js); // 0   js corresponding subscript, the first default subscript is 0

enum lan {
  js = 3,
  ts,
  css,
}
console.log(lan.js); // 3
console.log(lan.ts); // 4
console.log(lan.css); // 5

enum lan {
  js,
  ts = 3,
  css,
}
console.log(lan.js); // 0
console.log(lan.ts); // 3
console.log(lan.css); // 4
console.log(lan[4]); // css
console.log(lan[1]); // undefined
// The first default subscript is 0, and css continues the value of ts+1

enum lan {js = 'good', ts = 'nice', css = 'well'};
console.log(lan.js); // good

// const enumeration, in order to avoid overhead on additionally generated code and additional non-direct access to enumeration members.
const enum People {
  name: 'Alan',
  age: 23
}

// It will be automatically converted to a constant value during compilation, and other codes will not be retained
console.log(People.name); // Alan

```

## any

As the name suggests, any value, when we want to specify a type for a variable that is not yet clear,
