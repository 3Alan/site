  Package management tools are tools for managing project dependencies,
  including npm1/npm2, npm3/yarn and pnpm. npm3/yarn flattened the dependencies
  and placed them in the root directory, which has security and uncertainty
  issues. pnpm is fast, supports monorepo, and can reuse the same package
  through hard links to different projects. Code maintainability includes
  analyzability/readability, changeability/extensibility, and stability.

## Package Management Tools

> https://juejin.cn/post/6932046455733485575

- npm1/npm2
- npm3/yarn
- pnpm

### `npm1/2`

Uses a nested tree structure, and a large number of packages will be installed repeatedly.

### `npm3/yarn`

Flattens the dependencies (hoist) and places them in the root directory. However, there are security issues. The flattened structure caused by the flattening of dependencies allows the use of other packages that are not declared. For example: A depends on B, B depends on C, after flattening, A can also use C (ghost package). Uncertainty, for example, A depends on C1.0, B depends on C2.0, resulting in both C in A and C in B possibly being promoted to the root node, depending on the order of A and B in package.json.

### `pnpm`

- Fast
- Different projects can also reuse the same package through hard links
- Supports monorepo
- .pnpm store hardlink

## Code Maintainability

- Analyzability/readability
  - Quickly locate online problems
  - Code review
  - Reduce human factors and strengthen tool intervention (various lints)
  - Source-map positioning
- Changeability/extensibility
- Stability
  - Avoid modifying code to cause bugs
  - Core business code test coverage
