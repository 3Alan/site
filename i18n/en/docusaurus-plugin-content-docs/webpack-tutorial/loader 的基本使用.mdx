  This section mainly introduces the usage of `file-loader`, `url-loader` as
  well as `css-loader` and `style-loader`.


  `file-loader` can package files such as pictures into modules and output them
  to a specified directory.

  `url-loader` can convert files such as pictures into base64 encoding and
  output them to a specified directory.

  `css-loader` can package css files into modules and output them to a specified
  directory.

  `style-loader` can add css file content to the header of the page with
  `<style></style>` tag.

This section mainly talks about the usage of some common Loaders. Including `file-loader`, `url-loader` as well as `css-loader` and `style-loader`.

## Loader

### file-loader

The previous section briefly introduced what webpack is. Webpack is a module bundler that can package es module files. In the previous section, we only packaged js files. Can we package other types of files? Let's try to package pictures.

Here we use `file-loader`

```shell title="Install file-loader"
npm i file-loader -D
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="index.js" label="index.js">

```js title="index.js"
// ES Moudule modular import
import ComponentB from './componentB';

var root = document.getElementById('root');

// CommonJs module import
var ComponentA = require('./componentA');
var img1 = require('./IMG_3294.jpg');
console.log(img1);
var img = new Image();
img.src = img1;
root.append(img);

new ComponentA();
new ComponentB();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="webpack.config.js" label="webpack.config.js">

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development', // Defaults to production
  entry: {
    main: './src/index.js' // Packaged entry file
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      // Match files ending with jpg using file-loader
      {
        test: /\.jpg$/,
        use: {
          loader: 'file-loader'
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  output: {
    // Output file configuration
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  }
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

`npm run build` to package, let's take a look at the img1 printed out by the console

![img module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/20200515205827.png)

Here you can see that img1 is a `Module`.

We can get the path through `img1.default` or directly import it, so the picture is displayed successfully ðŸ˜„

```js
import img1 from './IMG_3294.jpg';
```

From this example, we can know the general function and method of loader. Use `test` to match specific files and use specific `loader` to process the files.

Let's take a look at the packaged file again

```
dist
 â”œâ”€â”€ a2099657cfcaf9f019ccf08e9dc8747d.jpg
 â”œâ”€â”€ bundle.js
 â””â”€â”€ index.html
```

It is found that the name of our picture has been changed to a long string of characters. Then how can I keep it from changing its name? This is when the **options** of the loader come in handy ðŸ˜Ž

```js title="webpack.config.js"
rules: [
  {
    test: /\.(jpg|png)$/,
    use: {
      loader: 'file-loader',
      options: {
        name: '[name].[ext]'
      }
    }
  }
];
```

Here `[name]` and `[ext]` are **placeholders** in the loader, representing the file name and suffix respectively. Of course, there are many more [placeholders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/file-loader/#placeholders) in the loader.

After setting, package to get the following result. You can see that the file name after packaging is consistent with that before packaging.

```
dist
 â”œâ”€â”€ bundle.js
 â”œâ”€â”€ IMG_3294.jpg
 â””â”€â”€ index.html
```

Now we know the basic usage of **file-loader**.

### url-loader

url-loader can also package files, but unlike file-loader, it will convert our pictures into base64 encoding. Then if I don't want to convert, we can use the limit property in options to limit the file to be converted into base64 encoding when it is less than a certain value. Once it is greater than this value, the packaged effect will be the same as file-loader.

Let's take a look at the example and it will be clear

```
npm i url-loader -D
```

Here we prepare two pictures, one is 300k in size and the other is 7k in size

```js title="webpack.config.js"
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development', // Defaults to production
  entry: {
    main: './src/index.js' // Packaged entry file
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(jpg|png)$/,
        use: {
          loader: 'url-loader',
          options: {
            name: '[name].[ext]',
            outputPath: 'images/',
            limit: 10240
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  output: {
    // Output file configuration
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  }
};
```

Take a look at the packaged file

```
dist
 â”œâ”€â”€ bundle.js
 â”œâ”€â”€ images
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 300k.jpg
 â””â”€â”€ index.html
```

The result is that the 300k.jpg file larger than 10240 is packaged as an image. So where did the 7k.jpg file go? We can find it in the `bundle.js` file.

```
data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAYABgAAD...
```

Of course, limit can also be set to true/false, [more configurations](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/url-loader/#limit)

I found during the operation that if 7k.jpg is not used in html, url-loader will not package it.

:::tip
It is not recommended to convert large files to base64 here, as this will increase the size of bundle.js, which is not friendly to project optimization
:::

### Style file

Continuing with the example above, I now want to add some styles to the pictures in the page

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="index.js" label="index.js">

```js
// ES Moudule modular import
import ComponentB from './componentB';
import './index.css';

var root = document.getElementById('root');

// CommonJs module import
var ComponentA = require('./componentA');
import img1 from './300k.jpg';
console.log(img1);

var img = new Image();
img.src = img1;
img.classList.add('circle');
root.append(img);

new ComponentA();
new ComponentB();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="index.css" label="index.css">

```css
.circle {
  width: 100px;
