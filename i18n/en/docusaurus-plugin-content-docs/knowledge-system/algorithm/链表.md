summary: >-
  1. The skill section introduces the virtual head node and the processing
  method of breaking the node link.

  2. The problem section introduces two problems: partition linked list and
  reorder linked list.

  3. The idea of reordering the linked list is to find the middle node, divide
  the linked list into two parts, reverse the second part of the linked list,
  and finally merge the two linked lists.

  4. Reordering the linked list involves knowledge points such as fast and slow
  pointers to find the middle node of the linked list, reversing the linked
  list, and merging the linked list.

## Skills

- Virtual head node `const dummy = new ListNode(-1);` as the start of the new node, finally return `dummy.next` when returning the new linked list. When you need to create a new linked list, you can use a virtual head node to simplify the processing of boundary conditions.
- If you need to connect the nodes of the original linked list to the new linked list instead of creating new nodes to form the new linked list, then it may be necessary to break the link between the node and the original linked list.

## Problems

[Partition List](https://leetcode.cn/problems/partition-list/description/) (Create 2 new linked lists for splicing)

### Reorder List

Idea: Find the middle node to divide the linked list into two parts, reverse the second part of the linked list, and finally merge the two linked lists

[Reorder List](https://leetcode.cn/problems/reorder-list/description/)

This problem involves the following knowledge points

- Fast and slow pointers to find the middle node of the linked list (related problem [Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.cn/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/description/))
- Reverse linked list (related problem [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.cn/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/))
- Merge linked lists (related problem [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.cn/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/))
