summary: >-
  Web performance optimization refers to improving the loading speed and
  interactive response speed of a website. Indicators for measuring the quality
  of web performance include loading time, first screen time, and interaction
  time.


  Web performance optimization can be carried out from two aspects: macro and
  code implementation. On the macro level, you can optimize server
  configuration, use CDN, and reduce the number of HTTP requests. In terms of
  code implementation, you can optimize image loading, use caching, and reduce
  repainting and reflow.


  In terms of interactive experience, you can optimize image loading, use
  caching, and reduce repainting and reflow.

Combined with two years of front-end development experience, let's talk about web performance optimization.

When we comment on the performance of a website, the most intuitive thing is the loading speed and interactive response speed of the website. For quantitative indicators, Google has actually proposed a set of indicators **web-vitals**.
