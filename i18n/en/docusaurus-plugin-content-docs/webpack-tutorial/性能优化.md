  1. This article introduces how to use TS, Eslint, and webpack to optimize
  project performance.

  2. When using TS, you need to install ts-loader and configure the
  tsconfig.json file.

  3. Eslint is used to unify the code style. You can use eslint-loader to check
  the code during packaging.

  4. webpack can support single-page applications by configuring
  devServer.historyApiFallback.

  5. webpack performance optimization includes reducing the use of unnecessary
  Loaders and Plugins, reasonably using Resolve's extensions, mainFiles and
  alias, using DllPlugin, multi-process packaging, sourceMap and other tools.

TS, Eslint, webpack performance optimization

<!--truncate-->

## Basic content

### Package TS file

Use ts-loader

```
npm i ts-loader typescript -D
```

The project directory is as follows:

```
ts-test
 â”œâ”€â”€ dist
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.js
 â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
 â”œâ”€â”€ src
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.tsx
 â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
 â””â”€â”€ webpack.config.js
```

`tsconfig.json` is the configuration file for TS. For more configurations, [see](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)

index.tsx

```tsx
interface person {
  name: string;
  ts?: boolean;
}
function Recruit(personObj: person): string {
  if (personObj.ts) {
    return `congratulations!${personObj.name}`;
  } else {
    return `sorry,${personObj.name}, we need a employee who know ts!`;
  }
}
let person1 = { name: 'Alan', age: 21, ts: true };
console.log(Recruit(person1));
let person2 = { name: 'Bob', age: 21 };
console.log(Recruit(person2));
```

tsconfig.json

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist/", // Since it is configured in webpack, it can be configured or not
    "module": "es6",
    "target": "es5",
    "allowJs": true
  }
}
```

webpack.config.js

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'production',
  entry: './src/index.tsx',
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: 'ts-loader'
      }
    ]
  },
  output: {
    filename: '[name].js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  }
};
```

**When our project installs a third-party library and wants to use it in a ts file, we need to install the `definitions ` of the third-party library. The specific library can be found in [TypeSearch](https://microsoft.github.io/TypeSearch/)**

### devServer.historyApiFallback

Single-page applications need to be configured in the development environment `devServer.historyApiFallbackï¼š true`

### Eslint

Eslint is used to unify the code style. When collaborating in a team, it can ensure that the code style written by everyone is unified, which is conducive to code maintenance.

How to use:

```
npm i eslint -D
```

Initialize configuration

```
npx eslint --init
```

After initializing the configuration, we can use it. Here I installed the airbnb standard.

![image-20200603151832567](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200603151832567.png)

The picture above shows that eslint prompts that jsx syntax cannot be used in js files, this....ðŸ˜°. What should I do if I want to use it? You can configure rules in the generated `.eslintrc.js` file to ignore this standard.

```js
rules: {
	'react/jsx-filename-extension': 0,
},
```

Since it is difficult to ensure that everyone's development environment is the same in team collaboration, we can combine eslint and webpack, and use a loader to check the code for eslint every time it is packaged, but this may affect the packaging speed. When using it, you need to make a choice between speed and code quality. Here is an introduction to the eslint-loader used

```
npm i eslint-loader -D
```

webpack.common.js configuration

```js
rules: [
    {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/, // Do not process js files under node_modules
        use: ['babel-loader', 'eslint-loader'],
    },
],
```

Of course, you can also set `devServer.overlay: true` to display errors in real time on the browser, which is convenient for debugging.

### Multi-page application packaging

Multiple entries need to be set, and multiple .html files are generated after packaging.

```
src
 â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
 â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
 â””â”€â”€ list.js
```

```js
// webpack's entry and plugins configuration
entry: {
    main: './src/index.js', // Entry file for packaging
    list: './src/list.js',
},
plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/index.html',
      filename: 'index.html',
      chunks: ['main'],
    }),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/index.html',
      filename: 'list.html',
      chunks: ['list'],
    }),
    new CleanWebpackPlugin(),
],
```

The directory generated after packaging

```
dist
 â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
 â”œâ”€â”€ list.8c4e5ed5eb6302c4c5ef.js
 â”œâ”€â”€ list.8c4e5ed5eb6302c4c5ef.js.map
 â”œâ”€â”€ list.html
 â”œâ”€â”€ main.acc2939e4489e5d76660.js
 â”œâ”€â”€ main.acc2939e4489e5d76660.js.map
 â”œâ”€â”€ vendors~list~main.2d42972bf2bf50e6d3cd.js
 â””â”€â”€ vendors~list~main.2d42972bf2bf50e6d3cd.js.map
```

**Now there are only two pages, which is okay. However, when there are more pages, we need to configure multiple HtmlWebpackPlugin. So how can we make it configure automatically? Here is a function to handle it**

```js
const generateHtmlPlugin = entry => {
  const plugins = [
    new CleanWebpackPlugin(),
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
      _: 'lodash'
    })
  ];

  Object.keys(entry).forEach(item => {
    plugins.push(
      new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        template: './src/index.html',
        filename: `${item}.html`,
        chunks: [item]
      })
    );
  });
  return plugins;
};
```

Complete webpack configuration (webpack.common.js)

```js
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require('clean-webpack-plugin');
const webpack = require('webpack');

const generateHtmlPlugin = entry => {
  const plugins = [
    new CleanWebpackPlugin(),
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
