summary: >-
  Website loading can be optimized through server-side rendering (SSR).
  Performance monitoring can be done using tools like pageSpeed, lighthouse,
  web-vitals, etc. Performance metrics include FCP, LCP, FID, CLS, etc. Caching
  can reduce HTTP requests and improve loading speed. Network optimization
  includes reducing HTTP requests, using HTTP2, HTTP cache 304, DNS prefetching,
  enabling gzip, etc. JS optimization includes using web workers,
  requestAnimationFrame for animation, event delegation, etc. CSS optimization
  includes reducing CSS repaints and reflows, placing CSS at the top and JS at
  the bottom, reducing CSS selector complexity, etc. Static resource
  optimization includes using CDNs, JS lazy loading, image lazy loading, webp
  format, progressive image optimization, responsive images, etc. SEO
  optimization includes semantic HTML tags, reducing unnecessary elements and
  nesting, using meaningful alt descriptions for images, specifying image width
  and height, TDK (title, description, keywords), structured data, preventing
  crawling of certain links by search engines, specifying landing pages, proper
  usage of h1 and h2 tags, etc.

## Website Loading

- Server-side rendering (SSR)

## Performance Monitoring

- pageSpeed
- lighthouse
- web-vitals

## Performance Metrics

- FCP
- LCP
- FID
- CLS

## Caching

### API Caching

For content that doesn't often change, API caching can be used, such as for category pages.

#### Caching Medium

- Redis for server-side rendering, [example](https://juejin.cn/post/6844904068217831438)
- localStorage for client-side rendering

## Network

- Reduce HTTP requests (for HTTP2 and below)
- Use HTTP2
- HTTP cache 304
- [DNS prefetching](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/Performance/dns-prefetch), use `<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/">` to prefetch third-party websites
- Enable gzip
- DNS cache (Node.js)

## JS

- Use web workers for high-computation tasks
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations and frame rate optimization
- Event delegation

## CSS

- Minimize CSS repaints and reflows
- Place CSS at the top and JS at the bottom (JS loading and execution block HTML parsing, or use defer)
- Reduce CSS selector complexity

## Static Resources

Prioritize using CDNs

### JS

- Lazy loading (code splitting)
- documentFragment
- Script loading
  ![Script Loading](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/images/asyncdefer.svg)

### Images

- Image lazy loading
  - Native
  - getBoundingClientRect
  - IntersectionObserver
- Webp format
- Progressive image optimization
- [Responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)

## SEO-related

- Use semantic HTML tags
- Reduce unnecessary elements and nesting
- Images should have clear and meaningful alt descriptions
- Specify image width and height, especially for above-the-fold images that affect CLS
- TDK (react-helmet)
  - title
  - description
  - keywords
- Structured data - [application/ld+json](https://moz.com/blog/json-ld-for-beginners)
- Prevent crawling of certain links by search engines using `<a href="xxx" rel="nofollow">`
- Specify canonical landing page with `<link rel="canonical" href="https://alanwang.site">`, preventing crawlers from crawling `https://alanwang.site?name='alan'`
- Proper usage of h1 and h2 tags
