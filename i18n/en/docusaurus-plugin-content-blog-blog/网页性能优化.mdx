title: A Brief Discussion on Webpage Performance Optimization
draft: true
tags:
  - Performance optimization
summary: >-
  Webpage performance optimization refers to improving a website's loading speed
  and interactive response speed. Indicators for measuring the quality of
  webpage performance include loading time, first screen time, interactive time,
  etc.


  Webpage performance optimization can be carried out from two aspects: macro
  and code implementation. On the macro level, server configuration can be
  optimized, CDN can be used, and the number of HTTP requests can be reduced. In
  terms of code implementation, image loading can be optimized, caching can be
  used, and repainting and reflow can be reduced.


  In terms of interactive experience, image loading can be optimized, caching
  can be used, and repainting and reflow can be reduced.

Combining two years of front-end development experience, let's briefly discuss webpage performance optimization.

When we comment on the performance of a website, the most intuitive thing is the loading speed and interactive response speed of the website. For quantitative indicators, Google has actually proposed a set of indicators **web-vitals**.
