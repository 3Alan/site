description: Common two pointers algorithm problems and their applications
summary: >-
  The two pointers algorithm is a common algorithmic approach that uses two
  pointers to traverse a data structure. Common types of two pointers algorithm
  include two pointers with opposite direction, two pointers with the same
  direction, and two pointers with opposite direction. The two pointers with
  opposite direction are commonly used for problems such as validating a
  palindrome string and finding two numbers that sum up to a target. The two
  pointers with the same direction are commonly used for problems such as
  removing the Nth node from the end of a linked list, detecting a cycle in a
  linked list, and reversing a linked list. The sliding window is a special type
  of two pointers algorithm that is often used for solving subarray problems.

## Common Types of Two Pointers Algorithm

- Two Pointers with Opposite Direction
- Two Pointers with the Same Direction
- Two Pointers with Opposite Direction

## Two Pointers with Opposite Direction

### Validating Palindrome String

### Validating Palindrome String II

There are two cases of deleting characters: deleting from the left side and deleting from the right side

### Two Sum

Sort the array first and then use two pointers

## Two Pointers with the Same Direction

### Removing Nth Node from the End of a Linked List

Use the distance of N between two pointers to achieve the fast pointer reaching the end, and the slow pointer will be the Nth node from the end

### Detecting a Cycle in a Linked List

Use fast and slow pointers with a while loop. If the fast pointer meets the slow pointer, it means there is a cycle

[leetcode](https://leetcode-cn.com/submissions/detail/266797412/)

### Reversing a Linked List

Use two pointers to keep track of the current node and the previous node. After keeping track, break the next link

### Fast and Slow Pointers

Commonly seen problems: modifying arrays in-place
