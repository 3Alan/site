summary: >-
  Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping
  adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, thus "bubbling" the larger
  elements to the end of the array.


  Quick sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that works by selecting a pivot
  element and partitioning the array into two sub-arrays, then recursively
  sorting these two sub-arrays.

## Bubble Sort (O(n^2)/O(1))

[LeetCode](https://leetcode-cn.com/submissions/detail/264736519/), compares adjacent elements and moves the larger ones to higher positions.

## Quick Sort (O(nlogn)/O(logn))

Keywords: Divide and conquer, sorting/searching

[LeetCode](https://leetcode-cn.com/submissions/detail/246649044/), achieves overall and local order, selects a pivot element, moves elements smaller than the pivot to the left, and moves elements larger than the pivot to the right.
