summary: >-
  - Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that supports the
  development and execution of smart contracts.

  - A smart contract is a program stored on the blockchain that can
  automatically execute the terms of a contract.

  - Gas fees are the fees required to execute a transaction and are determined
  by the amount of gas consumed and the gas price.

  - Crypto wallets are used to manage Ethereum accounts, storing private keys
  and addresses.

  - Ethereum development can be done using tools such as Next.js, Remix,
  Solidity, and more.

## Transaction Fees

### Gas

Gas, as a unit, is used to measure the computational effort required to execute a transaction, similar to how 'seconds' measure time.

`gas fee` can also be referred to as `transaction fee`.

### How are transaction fees calculated?

An upgrade in August 2021 changed the calculation rules, so there are two sets of rules:

- Pre-London Upgrade
- Post-London Upgrade

#### Pre-London Upgrade

`gas fees = gas spent * gas price`

- Gas Spent is the number of gas units consumed to execute the transaction
- Gas Price is the amount of ether you are willing to pay per gas unit, which is set by the user (higher bids get priority)

Gas Price can be expressed in a denomination called `Gwei` (Giga-Wei)

1 Gwei = 0.000000001 ETH

The smallest denomination of ETH is Wei

1 ETH = 10^9 Gwei = 10^18 Wei

#### Post-London Upgrade

`gas fees = gas spent * (base fees + priority fees)`

### How is Gas Spent calculated?

Before a smart contract is deployed to the Ethereum network, it is compiled into OPCODES (machine code), and each opcode has a fixed `gas cost`. Therefore, more complex contracts cost more gas.

ETH requires the least amount of gas since its operations are simple.

## Crypto Wallets

Used to manage accounts and connect to applications

- address (shareable, public)
- private keys (do not share, do not make public, cannot be recovered if lost)
- It is best not to use the same wallet for development and personal use
