  A Pod is the smallest deployable unit of computing that can be created and
  managed in Kubernetes, and consists of one or more containers. A Service is an
  abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to
  access them. Kubectl is the command-line tool for running commands against
  Kubernetes clusters.


  You can use the kubectl command to deploy applications to a Kubernetes
  cluster, list the deployed applications and Pods, create services, and list
  all namespaces.
