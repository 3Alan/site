## Xiaohongshu

- Have you customized hooks yourself?
  useOnClickOutSide

- The difference between class and hook and the drawbacks of hook, when is hook
  prone to bugs

  Hooks are more conducive to logic reuse, and classes need to use HOC
  Hook logic is more aggregated, and class logic is dispersed in various
  life cycles

- Algorithm question: getValueByKeyPath(obj, 'a.b'), lodash.get
- ts declaration problem

  ```ts
  interface Person {
    name: Number;
    [key: string]: String;
  }
  ```

  String is the wrapper type of js, string is the type of ts

- ts declares function

  ```ts
  const fn = userId => `${userId}123`;

  const fn: (userId: string) => string = userId => `${userId}123`;
  ```

- Macro task micro task question

  ```js
  const a = new Promise(resolve => {
    console.log(1);
    resolve(2);
    console.log(3);
  });

  a.then(value => {
    console.log(value);

    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(4);
    });
  });

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(5);
  }, 100);

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(6);
  }, 0);

  console.log(7);

  // 1372645
  ```

- js turns css to introduce performance optimization, from which angles to
  analyze, troubleshoot and optimize. The width of the carousel, the pixel
  clarity of the mobile and pc terminals

  Adaptive images: picture and img srcset. Analysis: With the help of
  performance testing tools (pageSpeed lightHouse)

- rem problem, assuming the page root is 33rem, how to deal with it, use loader
  or plugin to deal with it
- Have you ever written a loader by hand
- Is the loader from left to right or from right to left

  From right to left, use reduceRight

- Design patterns, and what have you used in the code to optimize the code, the
  difference between publish-subscribe and observer patterns
  https://juejin.cn/post/6844904138707337229

  - Decorator pattern: React HOC
  - Adapter pattern: Convert different data structures into a unified data
    interface, such as data structure conversion during admin refactoring
  - Proxy pattern: event delegation
  - Publish-subscribe pattern: Messages are obtained through broadcasting, and
    subscribers can get messages, one-to-many. Form component, with an
    intermediary
  - Observer pattern: no intermediary

- node.js, koa, koa compose, onion model
- Is React traversal depth traversal or breadth traversal, what is the
  difference between the two

  Depth traversal

- Why can't useState be placed in if

  The underlying React hook relies on the order in which the hooks are defined
  to execute. If it is declared in if, it will disrupt the order, and the
  linked list will be stored

- 100 network requests, at most 10 at a time, if the design allows 100
  requests to be executed as soon as possible. Promise.all has problems, such
  as the first batch of 10, 9 1s, and the remaining 1 100s, which will waste
  99s

  Concurrent request for interface

- Low code, 100 inputs, enter an input, how to optimize 100 without rendering
- Why is data in Vue a function
- Handwritten throttling, bind
- Prototype chain question (simple)
- Relatively difficult projects, projects with greater gains, and problems
  that trouble the upload component

## XTransfer

- flex: the meaning of 1
- Vertical centering
- Draw a triangle with css

  ```css
  div {
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
    border: 40px solid;
    border-color: transparent transparent red;
  }
  ```

- http2 multiplexing principle
- What happens after entering the url, focusing on the construction of the DOM
  tree
- Browser caching
- Why does the browser have cross-domain issues and how to solve cross-domain
  issues
- esm and cjs difference
- rollup and webpack difference
- webpack Tree Shaking and its implementation principle
- Have you done any webpack related optimizations
- Performance optimization: First screen loading speed, from which aspects to
  optimize
- Have you done any burying points or performance monitoring
- React diff algorithm, the process of depth-first traversal and the
  algorithm complexity
  - https://react.iamkasong.com/diff/prepare.html
  - https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/2034637
- The most difficult project encountered
- React Redux connect principle
- React Fiber architecture
- Why can't hooks be used in if
  The underlying React depends on the order of `hooks` [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#explanation)
- Handwritten function currying
- Handwritten Promise.all
- How to deal with the blurring of banner image loading
  - Progressive jpeg (fuzzy loading)
  - Non-progressive (up and down loading)
  - Prepare a thumbnail
- Views on overtime
- Closure and usage scenarios

## Heihu

- The most difficult problem encountered
- The intuitive difference between hooks and classes
- react performance optimization, PureComponent, memo
- Long list optimization
- The difference between webpack loader and plugin
- What webpack-level optimizations have been done
- js garbage collection mechanism
- Is there a problem that promise resolve and reject are not triggered
- Mini program is more basic
- react diff algorithm
- What problems does Fiber solve
- Buried points, error collection
- Margin overlap, BFC
- Programming questions

  ```js
  const data = [4,1,5,2];

  {value: 1, next: {value: 2, next: {value: 4, next: {value: 5}}}}
  ```

- Write a react login box
- Do the client, Heihu Intelligent Manufacturing Department, maintain the
  component library, and the efficiency of the background tools. Currently
  refactoring 3.0

## ebay Outsourcing

- http methods and return status codes
- restful api, when to use which http method
- cookie, setCookie, cookie properties
- Login authorization verification, page and component level permission
  verification
- Introduce ssr, what to pay attention to when developing ssr components
- How does the server handle css, svg, and img in ssr
  - The server does not handle it, use `ignore-loader`
  - react-loadable `collectChunks` handles it automatically? Then use
    `chunkExtractor.getCssString` to achieve it?
  - Different bundle configurations for client and server
- Why use rollup instead of webpack for packaging, how to test that there is no
  problem when rendering the server
- Introduce unit testing
- The difference between class component and function component
- Can hooks be written in conditional branches
- Component re
