description: Common two pointers algorithm questions and application scenarios
summary: >-
  The two pointers algorithm is a common algorithm idea that uses two pointers
  to traverse a data structure. Common two-pointer algorithm ideas include
  two-pointers in opposite directions, two-pointers in the same direction, and
  two-pointers in opposite directions. Two pointers in opposite directions are
  often used to verify palindrome strings, two-sum problems, etc. Two pointers
  in the same direction are often used to delete the Nth node from the end of a
  linked list, circular linked lists, reverse linked lists, etc. Sliding window
  is a special two-pointer algorithm that is often used to solve subarray
  problems.

## Common Two Pointers Algorithm Ideas

- Two pointers in opposite directions
- Two pointers in the same direction
- Two pointers in opposite directions

## Two Pointers in Opposite Directions

### Verifying Palindrome Strings

### Verifying Palindrome Strings II

There are two cases: deleting the left/right side

### Two Sum

Sort first, then use two pointers

## Two Pointers in the Same Direction

### Deleting the Nth Node from the End of a Linked List

Using the distance between the two pointers as N, when the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer is the Nth node from the end
[leetcode](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/)

### Circular Linked List

Fast and slow pointers, while loop, if the fast pointer meets the slow pointer, it proves there is a loop

[leetcode](https://leetcode-cn.com/submissions/detail/266797412/)

### Reversing a Linked List

Use two pointers to save current and prev respectively, save next, and then cut off the next association

[leetcode](https://leetcode-cn.com/submissions/detail/268415457/)

### Fast and Slow Pointers

Questions that generally appear: modify the array in place
