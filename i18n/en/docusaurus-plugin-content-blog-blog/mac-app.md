## Screen recording

### Screen Studio

The animation is very smooth, and many product promotional videos are recorded using it, but the price is a bit expensive, but it is a one-time purchase.

### Magnet

A split-screen tool that can split windows to any position on the screen, supports shortcut keys, is very easy to use, but costs $9.9. Raycast above also provides split-screen functionality, which is sufficient for everyday use
