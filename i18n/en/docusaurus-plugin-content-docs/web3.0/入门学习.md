summary: >-
  - Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that supports the
  development and execution of smart contracts.

  - A smart contract is a program stored on the blockchain that can
  automatically execute the terms of a contract.

  - Gas fees are the fees that need to be paid when executing a transaction,
  determined by gas consumption and gas price.

  - Crypto wallets are used to manage Ethereum accounts, storing private keys
  and addresses.

  - Ethereum development can use tools like Next.js, Remix, Solidity, etc.

## Transaction Fees

### Gas

Gas is a unit used to measure the computational effort required to execute a transaction, similar to how 'seconds' measure time.

`gas fee` can also be called `transaction fee`

### How are transaction fees calculated?

There was an upgrade in August 2021, so the calculation rules are divided into

- Pre-London Upgrade
- Post-London Upgrade

#### Pre-London Upgrade

`gas fees = gas spent * gas price`

- Gas Spent is the number of gas units consumed to execute a transaction
- Gas Price is the amount of ether you will pay per gas unit, which is defined by the user, and it's a first-price auction, meaning the highest bidder gets their transaction processed first

Gas Price can be denoted in a denomination called `Gwei`(Giga-Wei)

1 Gwei = 0.000000001 ETH

The smallest denomination of ETH is Wei

1 ETH = 10^9 Gwei = 10^18 Wei

#### Post-London Upgrade

`gas fees = gas spent * (base fees + priority fees)`

### Gas Spent Calculation Rules

Before a smart contract is deployed to the Ethereum network, it is compiled into OPCODES (machine code), and each machine code has a fixed `gas cost`, so the more complex the contract, the more expensive the gas

ETH requires the least amount of gas since it's a simple operation

## Crypto Wallets

Used to manage accounts, connect to applications

- address (shareable and public)
- private keys (do not share or disclose, cannot be recovered if lost)
- It's best not to use the same wallet for development and personal use

## Ethereum Development

### Tech Stack

- Next.js

### IDE

[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

### Solidity

Used to develop smart contracts, runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM)

### NFT
