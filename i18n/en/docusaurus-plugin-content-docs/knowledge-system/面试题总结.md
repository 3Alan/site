## Xiaohongshu

- Have you customized hooks yourself?
  useOnClickOutSide

- The difference between class and hook and the drawbacks of hook, when is hook
  prone to bugs

  Hooks are more conducive to logic reuse, and classes need to use HOC
  Hook logic is more aggregated, and class logic is分散 in various life
  cycles

- Algorithm question: getValueByKeyPath(obj, 'a.b'), lodash.get
- ts declaration problem

  ```ts
  interface Person {
    name: Number;
    [key: string]: String;
  }
  ```

  String is the wrapper type of js, string is the type of ts

- ts declares a function

  ```ts
  const fn = userId => `${userId}123`;

  const fn: (userId: string) => string = userId => `${userId}123`;
  ```

- Macro task micro task question

  ```js
  const a = new Promise(resolve => {
    console.log(1);
    resolve(2);
    console.log(3);
  });

  a.then(value => {
    console.log(value);

    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(4);
    });
  });

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(5);
  }, 100);

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(6);
  }, 0);

  console.log(7);

  // 1372645
  ```

- js turns css to introduce performance optimization, from which angles to
  analyze, troubleshoot and optimize. The width of the carousel, the pixel
  clarity of the mobile and pc ends

  Adaptive images: picture and img srcset. Analysis: With the help of
  performance testing tools (pageSpeed lightHouse)

- rem problem, assuming the page root is 33rem, how to deal with it, use loader
  or plugin to handle
- Have you ever handwritten a loader
- Is the loader from left to right or from right to left

  From right to left, use reduceRight

- Design patterns, and what have you used in the code to optimize the code,
  the difference between publish-subscribe and observer patterns
  https://juejin.cn/post/6844904138707337229

  - Decorator pattern: React HOC
  - Adapter pattern: Convert different data structures into a unified data
    interface, such as data structure conversion during admin reconstruction
  - Proxy mode: event delegation
  - Publish-subscribe mode: Messages are obtained through broadcasting, and
    subscribers can obtain messages, one-to-many. Form component, with an
    intermediary
  - Observer mode: no intermediary

- node.js, koa, koa compose, onion model
- Is React traversal depth traversal or breadth traversal, what is the
  difference between the two

  Depth traversal

- Why can't useState be placed in if

  React hook is executed based on the order of hook definition at the bottom.
  If it is declared in if, it will disrupt the order and the linked list will
  be stored

- 100 network requests, at most 10 at a time, if the design allows 100
  requests to be executed as soon as possible. Promise.all has problems, such
  as the first batch of 10, 9 1s, and the remaining 1 100s, which will waste
  99s

  Concurrent request for interface

- Low code, 100 inputs, enter an input, how to optimize 100 without rendering
- Why is data in Vue a function
- Handwritten throttling, bind
- Prototype chain question (simple)
- More difficult, more rewarding projects, upload component困扰 problems

## XTransfer

- flex: the meaning of 1
- Vertical centering
- Draw a triangle with css

  ```css
  div {
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
    border: 40px solid;
    border-color: transparent transparent red;
  }
  ```

- http2 multiplexing principle
- What happened after entering the url, focusing on the construction of the
  DOM tree
- Browser caching
- Why does the browser have cross-domain issues and how to solve cross-domain
  issues
- esm and cjs differences
- rollup and webpack differences
- webpack Tree Shaking and its implementation principle
- Have you done any webpack related optimizations
- Performance optimization: First screen loading speed, from which angles to
  optimize
- Have you done burying points or performance monitoring
- React diff algorithm, the process of depth-first traversal and the
  algorithm complexity
  - https://react.iamkasong.com/diff/prepare.html
  - https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/2034637
- The most difficult project encountered
- React Redux connect principle
- React Fiber architecture
- Why can't hook be used in if
  React bottom layer depends on the order of `hooks` [document](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#explanation)
- Handwritten function currying
- Handwritten Promise.all
- How to deal with the fuzzy loading of banner images
  - Progressive jpeg (fuzzy loading)
  - Non-progressive (up and down loading)
  - Prepare a thumbnail
- Views on overtime
- Closure and usage scenarios

## Heihu

- The most difficult problem encountered
- The intuitive difference between hook and class
- react performance optimization, PureComponent, memo
- Long list optimization
- The difference between webpack loader and plugin
- What webpack level optimizations have you done
- js garbage collection mechanism
- Is there a problem that promise resolve and reject are not triggered
- Small program偏底层
- react diff algorithm
- What problems does Fiber solve
- Burying points, error collection
- Margin overlap, BFC
- Programming questions

  ```js
  const data = [4,1,5,2];

  {value: 1, next: {value: 2, next: {value: 4, next: {value: 5}}}}
  ```

- Write a react login box
- Do the client, Heihu manufacturing department, maintain the component
  library, and the efficiency of the background tool. Currently, 3.0 is
  reconstructed

## ebay outsourcing

- http methods and return status codes
- restful api, when to use which http method
- cookie, setCookie, cookie properties
- Login permission verification, page and component level permission
  verification
- Introduce ssr, what to pay attention to when developing ssr components
- How does the server handle css, svg, and img in ssr
  - The server does not handle it, use `ignore-loader`
  - react-loadable `collectChunks` automatically handles it? Then use
    `chunkExtractor.getCssString` to achieve it?
  - The bundle configurations of client and server are different
- Why use rollup instead of webpack for packaging, how to test that there is
  no problem when rendering on the server
- Introduce unit testing
- The difference between class component and function component
- Can hook be written in a conditional branch
- Component re-rendering issues
- memo referencing object comparison issues
