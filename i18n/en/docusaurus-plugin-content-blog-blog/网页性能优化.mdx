summary: >-
  Web performance optimization refers to improving the loading speed and
  interaction responsiveness of a website. Metrics used to measure web
  performance include load time, first screen time, and interaction time.


  Web performance optimization can be done from both a macro and code
  implementation perspective. From a macro perspective, server configuration
  optimization, use of CDN, and reducing the number of HTTP requests can be
  done. From a code implementation perspective, image loading optimization,
  caching, and reducing repaint and reflow can be done.


  In terms of interaction experience, image loading optimization, caching, and
  reducing repaint and reflow can be done.

Combining two years of frontend development experience, let's discuss web performance optimization.

When we evaluate the performance of a website, the most intuitive factors to consider are the loading speed and interaction responsiveness of the website. Google has actually proposed a set of metrics called **web-vitals** for quantifying these factors.
