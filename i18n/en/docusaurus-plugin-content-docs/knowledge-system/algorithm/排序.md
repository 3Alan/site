summary: >-
  Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly comparing
  adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.


  Quick sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that works by selecting a pivot
  element, partitioning the array into two subarrays, and then recursively
  sorting the two subarrays.

## Bubble Sort (O(n^2)/O(1))

[leetcode](https://leetcode-cn.com/submissions/detail/264736519/), compare two by two, the larger one bubbles to the upper layer.

## Quick Sort \*(O(nlogn)/O(logn))

Keywords: partition sort/search

[leetcode](https://leetcode-cn.com/submissions/detail/246649044/), first sort the whole, then sort the part, select a benchmark, those less than the benchmark are on the left, and those greater than the benchmark are on the right.
