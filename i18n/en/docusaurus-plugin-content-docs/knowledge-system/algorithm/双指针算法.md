description: Common two pointers algorithm questions and application scenarios
summary: >-
  The two pointers algorithm is a common algorithm idea, which uses two pointers
  to traverse the data structure. Common two-pointer algorithm ideas include
  two-pointers of opposite directions, two-pointers of the same direction, and
  two-pointers of opposite directions. Two-pointers of opposite directions are
  often used to verify palindrome strings, two-sum problems, etc. Two-pointers
  of the same direction are often used to delete the Nth node from the end of a
  linked list, circular linked lists, reverse linked lists, etc. Sliding window
  is a special two-pointer algorithm, which is often used to solve subarray
  problems.

## Two-pointers of Opposite Directions

### Verify Palindrome String

### Verify Palindrome String â…¡

There are two cases: deleting the left/right side

### Two Sum

Sort first and then use two pointers

## Two-pointers of the Same Direction

### Delete the Nth Node from the End of a Linked List

Using the distance between the two pointers as N, when the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer is the Nth node from the end

### Circular Linked List

Fast and slow pointers, while loop, if the fast pointer meets the slow pointer, it proves that there is a loop

[leetcode](https://leetcode-cn.com/submissions/detail/266797412/)

### Reverse Linked List

Use two pointers to save current and prev respectively, and cut off the next association after saving

### Fast and Slow Pointers

Topics that usually appear: modify the array in place
