This introduces the comment system and some custom configurations

<!-- truncate -->

## Comment Functionality

### Register a LeanCloud International Account (In China, domain binding and filing are required)

Registration link: üëâhttps://console.leancloud.app/login.html#/signup

Afterwards, create an application with any name.

In the settings, find the application keys and copy the appid and appkey into the corresponding configuration in Hexo. Since this article focuses on email reply functionality, this part will not be elaborated further üòù. Let's get straight to the point.

- Modify the email template

  ![Comment Email Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200516161903124.png)

```html
<p>Hi, {{username}}</p>
<p>You have received a new reply to your comment on {{appname}}, please click the link below to check:</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="https://alanwang.site"
    style="display: inline-block; padding: 10px 20px; border-radius: 4px; background-color: #3090e4; color: #fff; text-decoration: none;"
    >View Now</a
  >
</p>
```

### Deploy Valine-Admin

First, perform the configuration

![LeanCloud Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200516163804087.png)

For more configuration options, refer to: https://github.com/DesertsP/Valine-Admin

```
https://github.com/DesertsP/Valine-Admin.git
```

I have also tried the version by zhaojun1998 online, but it will give an error when deployed in the international version. Based on the error message, it seems that the node version is too low, and even if the deployment is successful, the backend cannot be logged in. I have tested this version and it has no issues.

**The default deployment branch is master**

Click on deploy to proceed

![Deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200516164223578.png)

Click on the link to access the backend management system (here, you need to create a username and password by yourself in the \_User in Storage)

![Create Storage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200516164422299.png)

Here, you only need to fill in the username, password, and email. After adding them, you can successfully log in to the backend management system with the email and password.

![valine-admin Interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200516164630798.png)

Set up scheduled wake-up

```js
0 */30 7-23 * * ?
```

![Set Scheduled Wake-up](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200516164138651.png)

## Add Baidu Analytics

Complete the following steps

- Register a Baidu Analytics account
- Copy the analytics code

![Copy Analytics Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200604101820220.png)

- Paste the code into footer.ejs under `G:\blog\themes\volantis\layout\_partial`
- Configure `G:\blog\_config.yml`

```
baidu_analytics_key: the key value in the image above
```

- Check if the configuration was successful

You can directly use the code inspection on the official website to check. If it doesn't work, you can use the following method.

Check the network console to see if your website has requests starting with **hm**. If there are, it means that the configuration was successful, and you will be able to see the data in Baidu Analytics after about 20 minutes.

![Check Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200604102323835.png)

## Use hexo-admin for management

Install hexo-admin

```
npm i hexo-admin -S
```

Run the command

```
hexo s -d
```

Access it through localhost:4000/admin
If you want to use deploy in hexo-admin, you only need to configure it in \_config.yml

```yml
admin:
	deployCommand: './hexo-deploy.sh'
```

## hexo-abbrlink for permanent links

Before modification, the link looks like this

![Link Before Modification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200612183542458.png)

Once we modify the publication date of the article, the link will become invalid.

To solve this, we can use `hexo-abbrlink`

First, install it

```yml
npm i hexo-abbrlink -S
```

Modify the configuration in \_config.yml

```yml
permalink: posts/:abbrlink/
abbrlink:
  alg: crc32
  rep: hex
```

For detailed configuration, you can refer to the [hexo-abbrlink official website](https://github.com/rozbo/hexo-abbrlink)

Of course, if you want the link to be the same as your title, you don't need to install the `hexo-abbrlink` plugin, just modify the configuration

```yml
permalink: posts/:title
```

## Add nofollow to external links

Use [`hexo-filter-nofollow`](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-filter-nofollow) to automatically add the `nofollow` attribute to external links to prevent them from lowering the SEO weight of the website.

## Automatic search engine URL upload

Use the plugin [hexo-submit-urls-to-search-engine](https://github.com/cjh0613/hexo-submit-urls-to-search-engine)

## Deploy Hexo using Vercel

Currently, the access speed of Vercel in China is already very good, and since `github page` prohibits Baidu crawlers, I have moved from the previous `github page` deployment to Vercel deployment.

Since Vercel has the built-in `hexo` template, you don't need to type a lot of commands every time you deploy as before.

```yml
hexo clean
hexo g
hexo d
```

Configure package.json

```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "hexo generate && yarn deploy",
    "deploy": "hexo deploy",
  },
```

Vercel Configuration

![Vercel Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20211016103341684.png)

After finishing writing an article, simply push the code and it will be deployed automatically.

## TODO

- Optimize SEO
- Fine-tune styles
- Remove plug-ins that slow down loading speed
- Use CDN

## 404 Page after `hexo d` Deployment

When I deployed on a Mac, I encountered a 404 page issue. After comparing and troubleshooting, I found that it was caused by the Node version. Therefore, using the corresponding Node version will solve the problem.
