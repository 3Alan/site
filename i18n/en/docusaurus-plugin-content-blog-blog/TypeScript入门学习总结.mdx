## What is TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional **static typing** and class-based object-oriented programming to JavaScript. It can be compiled to pure JavaScript and cannot be executed in the browser without compilation. It can be understood as a relationship between CSS and less/sass and is similar to the relationship between TypeScript and JavaScript.

## Advantages of TypeScript

- TypeScript can perform dynamic type checking and detect potential bugs (such as spelling errors, missing parameters, undefined, etc.), improving code robustness.
- Development with vscode provides good code suggestions, improving development efficiency.
- TypeScript code has good readability.

## Creating the First TypeScript File

First, install TypeScript

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

Check if the installation is successful

```bash
tsc --version
```

I encountered the following problem after installation:

![image-20200614175730166](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200614175730166.png)

In this case, you only need to open the command line as an administrator and run the following command:

```bash
set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Create the first ts file `Hello.ts`

```tsx
function sayHello(name: String) {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
}
let person = 'Alan';
sayHello(person);
```

We found that the ts code is slightly different from ordinary js code in the parameter of the `sayHello` function.
`sayHello(name: String)`
Basically, it means that the `sayHello` function takes a parameter named `name`, and the type of this parameter must be `String`. If not, it will not pass the compilation of ts.
After writing the code, use `tsc` to compile the `Hello.ts` file:

```bash
tsc Hello.ts
```

After successful compilation, a `Hello.js` file will be generated in the same directory. You can see that the generated js file only converts es6 syntax to es5 syntax and does not change other code.

```js
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log('Hello ' + name);
}
var person = 'Alan';
sayHello(person);
```

If we modify the `Hello.ts` file as follows:

```tsx
function sayHello(name: String) {
  const text = 3 + name;
  console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
}
let person = 123;
sayHello(person);
```

If we compile it again, we will find an error, but the js file can still be generated:
![image-20200614180440953](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200614180440953.png)

The specific meaning of the error is:
- Since the function parameter `name` is declared as a static type `string`, but `123` of type `number` is passed in, which does not match the previous `string` type.
- In the `sayHello` function, two different types of values, `name(string)` and `3(number)`, are added together.

We found that every time we need to use `tsc` to compile the ts file to get the js file and then run the js file, which is too cumbersome. We can use the `ts-node` plugin to directly run ts files.

```bash
npm i ts-node -g
```

```bash
ts-node Hello.ts
```

:::info

TS can try to analyze variable types (type inference). It is better to explicitly declare variable types (type annotations) for variables that TS cannot analyze.

:::

## Basic Types

Variable declaration: `let [variable name]: [type] = value`

For example: `let age: number = 21`

TypeScript supports almost the same data types as JavaScript:

- boolean
- number
- string
- `[]/Array<element type>` (array)
- Tuple
- enum
- any
- void
- null
- undefined
- never

## Arrays

There are 2 ways to define arrays

```tsx
let arr: number[] = [1, 2, 3]; // element type followed by `[]`
let arr: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3]; // array generics
let arr: (number | string)[] = [1, '2', '4']; // element types can be number or string (similar to tuples)
```

## Tuples

Represents an array where the types of certain elements are known (the types of the elements do not have to be the same)

```tsx
let list: [string, number]; // the first element is of type string, the second is of type number
a = ['abc', 123]; // valid
b = [123, 'abc']; // invalid
```

## Enum

It's actually similar to an object. Look at the example:

```tsx
enum lan {js, ts, css};
console.log(lan.js); // 0  js corresponds to the index, the first default index is 0

enum lan {
  js = 3,
  ts,
  css,
}
console.log(lan.js); // 3
console.log(lan.ts); // 4
console.log(lan.css); // 5

enum lan {
  js,
  ts = 3,
  css,
}
console.log(lan.js); // 0
console.log(lan.ts); // 3
console.log(lan.css); // 4
console.log(lan[4]); // css
console.log(lan[1]); // undefined
// The first default index is 0, css follows ts's value +1

enum lan {js = 'good', ts = 'nice', css = 'well'};
console.log(lan.js); // good

// const enum, to avoid overhead on generated code and extra non-direct access to members on enums.
const enum People {
  name: 'Alan',
  age: 23
}

// It will be automatically converted to constant value during compilation and will not retain other code
console.log(People.name); // Alan

```

## any

As the name suggests, it is any value. When we want to specify a type for a variable that is not yet known, `any` is the best choice 🤭

```tsx
let a: any = 4;
a = '123'; // valid

let arr: any[] = [1, '123', true]; // similar to tuples
arr[1] = 'good';
```

## void

Commonly used for function declarations that do not have a return value

```tsx
function func(): void {
  console.log('learning typescript...');
}
func(); // valid

function func(): void {
  return 1;
}
func(); // invalid: Type '1' is not assignable to type 'void'
```

## null and undefined

They are not very useful by default. By default, they are subtypes of all types. For example, the following code is valid:

```tsx
let a: string;
a = undefined;
a = null;
```

**However**, when the `--strictNullChecks` flag is specified, null and undefined can only be assigned to void and themselves.

## never

Represents the type of values that never occur.
The type never is a subtype of every type and can be assigned to any type. However, there is no type that can be assigned to never (except never itself).

```tsx
function error(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}

// Functions that have no reachable endpoint
function infiniteLoop(): never {
  while (true) {}
}
```

## Object Destructuring

```tsx
function sayAge({ name, age }: { name: string | number; age: number }): void {
  console.log(`${name} is ${age} years old`);
}
sayAge({ name: 'Alan', age: 22 });
sayAge({ name: 2, age: 22 });
```

## Union Types

Use `|` to represent multiple possible values

```tsx
let a: string | number;
a = 1;
a = 'A';
```

## Type Assertion

You can specify the type of a value yourself.
The format is either `<type>value` or `value as type`.

```tsx
interface student {
  isStudent: boolean;
  education: number;
}
interface worker {
  isStudent: boolean;
  seniority: number;
}
function Recruit(candidate: worker | student): void {
  if (candidate.isStudent) {
    console.log(`your education is ${(candidate as student).education}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`your seniority is ${(candidate as worker).seniority}`);
  }
}

const a: student = { isStudent: true, education: 4 };
const b: worker = { isStudent: false, seniority: 2 };
Recruit(a);
Recruit(b);
```

Because `candidate` uses a union type, TypeScript cannot determine whether `candidate` belongs to `student` or `worker`, so you need to use type assertion to explicitly tell TypeScript.

Of course, there are other ways to achieve the same result.

```tsx
interface student {
  isStudent: boolean;
  education: number;
}
interface worker {
  isStudent: boolean;
  seniority: number;
}
function Recruit(candidate: worker | student): void {
  'education' in candidate &&
    console.log(`your education is ${candidate.education}`);
  'seniority' in candidate &&
    console.log(`your seniority is ${candidate.seniority}`);
}

const a: student = { isStudent: true, education: 4 };
const b: worker = { isStudent: false, seniority: 2 };
Recruit(a);
Recruit(b);
```

- typeof
- instanceof

## Non-null Assertion Operator

`!.` corresponds to `--strictNullChecks`

```ts
interface person {
  name: string;
}
function work(personObj?: person) {
  // `personObj` may not be passed, so `personObj` may be undefined. Use `!.` to assert that `personObj` is not empty
  console.log(personObj!.name);
}
```

## Interfaces

Let's first look at an example of an interface:

```tsx
interface person {
  name: string;
}
function work(personObj: person) {
  console.log(personObj.name);
}
let person1 = { name: 'Alan', age: 21 };
work(person1);
let person2 = { age: 21 };
work(person2);
```

![image-20200615180720618](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200615180720618.png)

The keyword for defining an interface is `interface`.
In this example, the parameter passed to `work` must be an object with a name(string) property. You can think of it as recruiting an employee with a name. Employees without names are not needed. However, when we directly pass the parameter, an error will occur.

```js
work({ name: 'Alan', age: 21 });
```

If the attributes other than the name that the employee to be recruited may have are unknown, you can redefine the interface as shown below to solve the above problem.

```tsx
interface person {
  name: string;
  [propName: string]: any;
}
```

### Optional Properties

If I want to recruit employees who know TypeScript the best, TypeScript is optional (it would be nice to know, hehe 😜), then we need to use **optional properties**. Add a `?` after the optional property name.

```tsx
interface person {
  name: string;
  ts?: boolean;
}
function Recruit(personObj: person): string {
  if (personObj.ts) {
    return `congratulations! ${personObj.name}`;
  } else {
    return `sorry, ${personObj.name}, we need an employee who knows TypeScript!`;
  }
}
let person1 = { name: 'Alan', age: 21, ts: true };
console.log(Recruit(person1));
let person2 = { name: 'Bob', age: 21 };
console.log(Recruit(person2));
```

### Readonly Properties

As we all know, a person's name cannot be changed (under normal circumstances), so we can modify the person interface by adding `readonly` before the property name.

:::tip

Of course, you can also use setter/getter to achieve this.

:::

```tsx
interface person {
  readonly name: string;
}
let person1: person = { name: 'Alan' };
person1.name = 'Bob'; // Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
```

**We found that the roles of readonly and const seem to be somewhat similar, so when should we use readonly and when should we use const?**
Variable---->const
Property---->readonly

### Function Type Interfaces

Interfaces can also be used to describe function types. Here is an example of a function used to check if you have clocked in 😁

```tsx
interface attendanceFunc {
  (name: string, startTime: number, endTime: number): boolean;
}
let checkAttendance: attendanceFunc;
checkAttendance = function (
  name: string,
  startTime: number,
  endTime: number
): boolean {
  let result = startTime < 9 && endTime > 18;
  return result;
};
console.log(checkAttendance('Alan', 10, 19)); // false
```

Let's see the declaration of the interface:

```tsx
interface attendanceFunc {
  (name: string, startTime: number, endTime: number): boolean;
}
```

`name, startTime, endTime` put in `()` represents the parameters of the function
`: boolean` represents the return value type of the function
Of course, the parameters and return value types of `checkAttendance` can be omitted, because `checkAttendance` is assigned to the variable `attendanceFunc`, and the type checker will automatically infer the types of parameters and return values (in the order of parameters in the interface), which means it is also valid to write as follows. **The parameter names in the function do not have to be the same as those in the interface**

```tsx
interface attendanceFunc {
  (name: string, startTime: number, endTime: number): boolean;
}
let checkAttendance: attendanceFunc;
checkAttendance = function (n, startTime, endTime) {
  let result = startTime < 9 && endTime > 18;
  return result;
};
console.log(checkAttendance('Alan', 10, 19)); // false
```

### Interface Inheritance

An interface can inherit one or more interfaces:
Inheritance uses the keyword `extends`

```tsx
interface person {
  name: string;
}
interface student {
  studentId: number;
}
interface seniorStudent extends person, student {
  grade: string;
}
let student1: seniorStudent = { name: 'Alan', studentId: 1, grade: 'one' };
console.log(student1);
```

## Class

Classes in TS are similar to classes in ES6, with the difference being

### Variable Modifiers

- public (default)
- private (cannot be accessed outside the class that declares it)
- protected (similar to private, but protected variables can be accessed in derived classes (i.e., subclasses))

### Static Properties

```tsx
class Person {
  static fingerNum = 5;
}

// Can only be accessed through the class
console.log(Person.fingerNum);
// Cannot be accessed through the instance
console.log(new Person().fingerNum);
```

```tsx
// Create a single instance for the singleton pattern
class singleClass {
  private static instance: singleClass;
  private constructor(public name: string) {}

  static getInstance() {
    if (!this.instance) {
      this.instance = new singleClass('Alan');
    }
    return this.instance;
  }
}

const class1 = singleClass.getInstance();
const class2 = singleClass.getInstance();
console.log(class1.name); // Alan
console.log(class1 === class2); // true
```

### Constructors

```tsx
class Person {
  constructor(name, mobile, sex) {
    this.name = name;
    this.mobile = mobile;
    this.sex = sex;
  }
  public name: string;
  private mobile: string;
  protected sex: string;
}
```

The above code can be simplified as follows:

```tsx
class Person {
  constructor(name: string, private mobile: string, protected sex: string) {}
}
```

### Abstract Classes

- Cannot be instantiated
- Need to be declared by derived classes and override abstract methods

```tsx
abstract class Animal {
  constructor(public name: string) {}
  sayHello() {
    console.log('hello');
  }
  // Declare abstract method
  abstract action(): void;
}

class Bird extends Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }
  action() {
    console.log('jijiji');
  }
}

const bird = new Bird('qc');
console.log(bird);
// Bird { name: 'qc' }
```

## Generics

> Generics is a feature where types are not specified in advance when defining functions, interfaces, or classes, but are specified when used.

### Function Usage: `<generic name>`

```tsx
function Recruit<T>(name: string, props: T) {
  return name + props;
}
// Explicitly specify T as number type
console.log(Recruit<number>('Alan', 123)); // Alan123
// TS automatically infers it as number type, same as the previous one
console.log(Recruit('Alan', 123)); // Alan123
console.log(Recruit('Alan', [1, 2, 3])); // Alan1,2,3
```

You can also use multiple generic names. The following example combines interfaces to achieve this:

```tsx
interface Contact {
  mobile: string;
}

interface Address {
  province: string;
}

function Recruit<C extends Contact, A extends Address>(
  name: string,
  contact: C,
  address: A
) {
  return `${name}'s mobile is ${contact.mobile}, live in ${address.province}`;
}

console.log(
  Recruit('Alan', { mobile: '666' }, { province: 'Shanghai' })
);
// Alan's mobile is 666, live in Shanghai
```

### Class Usage

```tsx
interface employee {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

class RecruitManager<T extends employee> {
  constructor(private data: Array<T>) {}
  select(age: number): T {
    return this.data.find(item => item.age > age);
  }
}

const result = new RecruitManager([
  {
    name: 'Alan',
    age: 22
  },
  {
    name: 'Bob',
    age: 18
  }
]);
console.log(result.select(20));
```

### Generic Constraints

Use `extends` to constrain generic types

```tsx
interface info {
  mobile: string;
}

// T must satisfy info
function Recruit<T extends info>(name: string, props: T) {
  return name + props.mobile;
}

console.log(Recruit('Alan', { mobile: '1232910830' })); // Alan1232910830
```
