  A Pod is the smallest deployable unit of computing that you can create and
  manage in Kubernetes. A Pod is made up of one or more containers. A Service is
  an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to
  access them. Kubectl is the command-line tool for running commands against
  Kubernetes clusters.


  You can use kubectl commands to deploy applications to a Kubernetes cluster,
  list the deployed applications and pods, create a service, list all
  namespaces.
