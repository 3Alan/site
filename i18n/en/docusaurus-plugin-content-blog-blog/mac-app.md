## Screen Recording

### Screen Studio

The animation is very smooth, and many promotional videos for products are recorded using it. The only downside is that it is a bit expensive, but it is a one-time purchase.

<SiteCard
  name="Screen Studio"

  title="Screen Recorder for macOS. Beautiful videos in minutes | Screen Studio"

## Browsers

### Arc

A very stylish browser. Currently, there are 5 invitation codes available. If you want to try it, please leave a message below.

## Development Tools

### Termius

[Website](https://termius.com/)

An SSH client with a free version. Students with the GitHub student package can get the Pro version for free.

## Productivity Tools

### Raycast

An absolute productivity tool where all operations can be completed in one search box. For Windows users, I recommend [utools](https://u.tools/).

<SiteCard
  name="Raycast"
  url="https://www.raycast.com/"
  title="Raycast - Supercharged productivity"
  description="Raycast lets you control your tools with a few keystrokes. It's designed to keep you focused."

### Magnet

[Website](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/)

A window management tool that allows you to split windows to any position on the screen. It supports shortcuts and is very easy to use. However, it costs $9.9. Raycast mentioned above also provides split screen functionality, which is sufficient for daily use.

### Snipaste

[Website](https://www.snipaste.com/index.html)

A screenshot tool that I have been using. It supports both Windows and Mac.
