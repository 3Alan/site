description: Common linked list algorithm questions and application scenarios
draft: true
summary: >-
  1. The skill section introduces the virtual head node and the method of
  breaking the node connection.

  2. The question section introduces two questions: partition linked list and
  reorder linked list.

  3. The idea of reordering the linked list is to find the middle node, divide
  the linked list into two parts, reverse the second part of the linked list,
  and finally merge the two linked lists.

  4. Reordering linked lists involves knowledge points such as finding the
  middle node of a linked list with fast and slow pointers, reversing a linked
  list, and merging linked lists.

## Skills

- Virtual head node `const dummy = new ListNode(-1);` as the start of the new node, and finally return `dummy.next` when returning the new linked list. When a new linked list needs to be created, a virtual head node can be used to simplify the processing of boundary conditions.
- If you need to connect the nodes of the original linked list to the new linked list instead of creating a new node to form a new linked list, then it may be necessary to disconnect the link between the node and the original linked list.

## Questions

[Partition List](https://leetcode.cn/problems/partition-list/description/) (Create 2 new linked lists for splicing)

### Reorder List

思路：Find the middle node to divide the linked list into two parts, reverse the second part of the linked list, and finally merge the two linked lists

[Reorder List](https://leetcode.cn/problems/reorder-list/description/)

This question involves the following knowledge points

- Find the middle node of a linked list with fast and slow pointers (related question [Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.cn/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/description/))
- Reverse a linked list (related question [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.cn/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/))
- Merge linked lists (related question [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.cn/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/))
