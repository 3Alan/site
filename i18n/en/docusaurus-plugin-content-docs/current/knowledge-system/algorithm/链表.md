description: Common linked list algorithm problems and their application scenarios
draft: true
summary: >-
  1. The technique section introduces the methods for handling virtual head
  nodes and disconnecting node links.

  2. The problem section introduces two problems: partitioning a linked list and
  reordering a linked list.

  3. The approach for reordering a linked list is to find the middle node,
  divide the list into two parts, reverse the second part, and finally merge the
  two lists.

  4. Reordering a linked list involves knowledge of finding the middle node
  using fast and slow pointers, reversing a linked list, and merging two linked
  lists.

## Techniques

- Use a virtual head node `const dummy = new ListNode(-1);` as the starting point for the new list. When returning the new list, only the `dummy.next` needs to be returned. Using a virtual head node simplifies the handling of boundary cases when creating a new list.
- If you need to connect a node from the original list to the new list instead of creating a new node, disconnecting the node and the link to the original list may be necessary.

## Problems

[Partition List](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/) (Create two new lists and concatenate them)

### Reorder Linked List

Approach: Find the middle node and divide the linked list into two parts. Reverse the second part of the list and finally merge the two lists.

[Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)

This problem involves the following key points:

- Using fast and slow pointers to find the middle node in a linked list (related problem: [Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/))
- Reversing a linked list (related problem: [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/))
- Merging two linked lists (related problem: [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/))
