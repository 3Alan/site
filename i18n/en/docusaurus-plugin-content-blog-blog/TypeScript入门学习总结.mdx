summary: >-
  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which adds optional static types and
  class-based object-oriented programming on top of JavaScript. TypeScript can
  be compiled into pure JavaScript. Uncompiled ts code cannot be executed in the
  browser. We understand its relationship with JavaScript as the relationship
  between css and less, sass.


  TypeScript has the following advantages:


  - Dynamic type checking can detect some potential bugs (such as spelling
  errors, missing parameters, undefined, etc.), improving code robustness.

  - Using vscode for development can provide good code prompts and improve
  development efficiency.

  - Good code readability.


  The basic types of TypeScript include: boolean, number, string, array, tuple,
  enumeration, any, void, null and undefined.


  Classes in TypeScript are very similar to classes in ES6. The difference is
  that classes in TypeScript can have access modifiers (public, private,
  protected), static properties, and abstract methods.


  Generics in TypeScript refer to the feature of not specifying a specific type
  when defining a function, interface, or class, but specifying the type when
  using it. Generics can improve code reusability.


  React related knowledge in TypeScript includes:


  - Class component dynamically sets state: You can use `this.setState({ [name]:
  value } as Pick<CompontentState, keyof CompontentState>)` to dynamically set
  state.

## What is TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which adds optional **static types** and class-based object-oriented programming on top of JavaScript. It can be compiled into pure JavaScript. Uncompiled ts code cannot be executed in the browser. We can understand its relationship with JavaScript as the relationship between css and less, sass.

## What are the advantages of TypeScript

- TS can perform dynamic type checking, which can detect some potential bugs (such as spelling errors, missing parameters, undefined, etc.), improving code robustness
- Using vscode for development can provide good code prompts and improve development efficiency
- Good code readability

## Create the first TypeScript file

First install TypeScript

```
npm install -g typescript
```

See if it is successful after installation

```
tsc --version
```

I encountered the following problem after installation:

![image-20200614175730166](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200614175730166.png)

In this case, you only need to run the following command as an administrator in the command line:

```
set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Create the first ts file `Hello.ts`

```tsx
function sayHello(name: String) {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
}
let person = 'Alan';
sayHello(person);
```

We find that the ts code is different from the ordinary js code in the parameter of the `sayHello` function.
`sayHello(name: String)`
Generally speaking, it means that `sayHello` passes in a parameter named name, and the type of the parameter must be `String`, otherwise it cannot pass the compilation of ts.
After writing the code, use tsc to compile the `Hello.ts` file above

```
tsc Hello.ts
```

After the compilation is successful, a `Hello.js` file is generated in the same level directory. It can be seen that the generated js file only converts the es6 syntax to es5 syntax, and does not change other codes.

```js
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log('Hello ' + name);
}
var person = 'Alan';
sayHello(person);
```

If you change the `Hello.ts` file

```tsx
function sayHello(name: String) {
  const text = 3 + name;
  console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
}
let person = 123;
sayHello(person);
```

Compile again and find that an error will be reported, but the js file can still be generated:
![image-20200614180440953](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Alan/images/master/img/image-20200614180440953.png)

The specific meaning of the above error is

- Since the function parameter `name` is declared as a static type `string`, the value passed in when calling is `number` type `123`, which does not match the previous `string`.
- In the `sayHello` function, two values of different types, `name(string)` and `3(number)`, are added together.

We found that every time we have to compile the ts file through tsc to get the js file and then run the js file, it is too troublesome. You can use the `ts-node` plugin to directly run the ts file.

```
npm i ts-node -g
```

```
ts-node Hello.ts
```

:::info

ts can try to analyze variable types (type inference), and ts cannot analyze variables. It is best to explicitly declare variable types (type annotations)

:::

## Basic types

Variable declaration: `let [variable name]: [type] = value`

For example: `let age: number = 21`

TypeScript supports almost the same data types as JavaScript

- boolean (Boolean value)
- number (numerical)
- string (string)
- `[]/Array<element type>(array)`
- Tuple
- enum (enumeration)
- any (any value)
- void (empty value)
- null
- undefined
- never

## Array

There are 2 ways to define an array

```tsx
let arr: number[] = [1, 2, 3]; // Element type followed by `[]`
let arr: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3]; // Array generics
let arr: (number | string)[] = [1, '2', '4']; // Element types can be number or string (similar to tuples)
```

## Tuple tuple

Represents an array (the types of each element do not have to be the same)

```tsx
let list: [string, number]; // The first element is of type string, and the second is of type number
a = ['abc', 123]; // qualified
b = [123, 'abc']; // unqualified
```

## Enumeration

It's actually a bit like an object
Look at the example

```tsx
enum lan {js, ts, css};
console.log(lan.js); // 0   js corresponding subscript, the first default subscript is 0

enum lan {
  js = 3,
  ts,
  css,
}
console.log(lan.js); // 3
console.log(lan.ts); // 4
console.log(lan.css); // 5

enum lan {
  js,
  ts = 3,
  css,
}
console.log(lan.js); // 0
console.log(lan.ts); // 3
console.log(lan.css); // 4
console.log(lan[4]); // css
console.log(lan[1]); // undefined
// The first default subscript is 0, and css continues the value of ts+1

enum lan {js = 'good', ts = 'nice', css = 'well'};
console.log(lan.js); // good

// const enumeration, in order to avoid overhead on additionally generated code and additional non-direct access to enumeration members.
const enum People {
  name: 'Alan',
  age: 23
}

// It will be automatically converted to a constant value during compilation, and other codes will not be retained
console.log(People.name); // Alan

```

## any

As the name suggests, any value, when we want to specify a type for a variable that is not yet clear, `any` is the best choice ðŸ¤­

```tsx
let a: any = 4;
a = '123'; // qualified

let arr: any[]
